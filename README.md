# 🌱 Smart Plant Watering System using ESP32  

## 📌 Overview  
The **Smart Plant Watering System** is an IoT-based project designed to automate plant irrigation based on **soil moisture levels**. It uses an **ESP32 microcontroller**, **soil moisture sensor**, and a **water pump** to ensure plants receive the right amount of water. The system integrates with **Blynk IoT** for remote monitoring and control.  

This project is **ideal for home gardens, greenhouses, and agricultural applications**, ensuring water conservation and optimal plant growth.
